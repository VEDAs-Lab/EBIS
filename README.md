# BuRnSNet: BURN REGION SEGMENTATION NETWORK FROM COLOR IMAGES WITH TWO-WAY CNN

#### Extended Burn Image Segmentation Dataset and BuRnSNet model (Accepted in ICIP 2024)

This repository is **EBIS dataset** and the official implementation of the architecure proposed in the **BuRnSNet paper**.
#### Paper link: will be available soon.

## Introduction
We developed a new dataset comprising high-resolution burn images with varied illumination conditions, different source cameras, and varying distances between the patient and the camera. This dataset was created using semi-automated scripts on Google search engine with queries such as ‘skin burn’, ‘burn wounds’, ‘burn injuries’, ‘full thickness burns’, ‘partial thickness burns’, ‘deep burn’, etc. The images include burns on the back, hand, face, and inner-forearm body parts. Further, we manually annotated these images pixel-wise, classifying each pixel as either burn or non-burn. The annotations are done under the consultation of a medical expert who has over three decades of experience in burns diagnosis and treatment. The sample images from the prepared dataset and their corresponding labeled images are illustrated in Figure below. The dataset consists of 316 images in the training set, 76 images in the validation set, and 208 images in the test set.
